# Implementation Details
+ Allows for all valid command line parsing
+ Includes all socket creation commands for both the server and client

# Todos
- Client server model was unable to be implemented but code is compiling.
- The code holds valid and executable code to send and receive a message
- The code does not receive input from standard input and it does not output the message to the standard output
- The code did not use the threading to allow for send/recv blocking requirements
- (I still had a lot to do with this project since I was barely getting familiar with C)
